            <h3> <li>Buying a fan in Korea</h3>

            <p class = "text">When does your fan stop working? In the states, when we turn it off. In Korea, 
            the fan stops when the timer is up. <br>A persistent superstition still today influences 
            the design of this household product. Every fan will come with a timer setting not a simple
            on and off. The myth is that if you run a fan in a room with no windows open you run the risk
            of dying from asphyxiation. 
             Every year in the summer months a few “fan deaths” will be reported on the local news. </p>

             <h3><li>Buddha, a Snake &amp; Sailors</h3>

            <p>While exploring a beach in Myanmar, my friends and I rounded the end of a cove and on dark rocks 
            on top of the sand in a cove was a large sculpted snake with paint fading, hood flared, Buddha 
            sitting on his coiled body. The huge figure faced the sea. We wandered around the structure which 
            did not reveal any new information. Later we learned that this was called Mucalinda. It is a depiction
            of Naga (a snake) sheltering Buddha from a storm drawn from a story of the Buddha. We were told that 
            this particular cove was for the men who worked on the fishing boats in the area for their protection. </p>

            <h3><li> Ibadi Islam in Oman</h3>
           
                <p>If you have some familiarity with Islam you have likely heard about the division between Sunni and Shi’ia.
            When I signed a contract to teach in Oman, I read most of the web pages on the first search page of google. 
            In Oman, Ibadi Islam is the predominant religion. Ibadi Islam dominates the culture of Oman. Though
            conservative in its own beliefs, Ibadi Islam and Oman are very tolerant of different cultures and religions 
            residing alongside. This could be in part influenced by its centuries long history as a port between India 
            and Africa. Oman has a moderate foreign-policy and has played host to peace talks. Ibadi Islam is woven into
            the culture of Oman and helped unify the many different tribes in the region.</p>

        <h3><li>New Years in Vietnam</h3>

            <p>I stayed for a month in a town in Vietnam near China called Sapa O’Chau. I taught English classes during the 
            day in exchange for room and board. My students were H’mong from the surrounding rural area. The org called 
            Sapa O’Chau housed the students so they could get to the only high school in the area and covered high school 
            fees. One of the weeks I was there was Tet, Vietnamese New Year. Because I was with the school I was invited to
            some of the students’ and admins’ homes. We sat on the floor around a large cloth passing bowls of pork and
            cabbage and many many other dishes. Eventually, as I knew it would, the most novel food made it to me.
            A bowl of pig’s blood. I was sitting next to the director of the org who offered the bowl to me saying, 
            “Will you try some blood?”. I hesitated and she made the decision for me, spooning a red gelatinous liquid
            into my mouth. It was salty.</p>

        <h3><li>Toy Guns in America</h3>
           <p> In my first month in Korea, I was walking down a busy street to my bus stop. Halfway from my home I saw a 
            black gun laying on the sidewalk, all other pedestrians passing by. I halted and looked closer. Surely it 
            couldn’t be real? Why had it sat here so long? What made this gun, now looking closer, obviously plastic, 
            so startling to me? 
            Later showing the picture to a friend and recounting the story I realized why I had assumed the gun was real. 
            How do I know if a gun in America is fake? There’s an orange tip to distinguish it. 
            In Korea toy guns don’t need to be distinguished from a real gun. Because no one is worried about a real gun. </p>
